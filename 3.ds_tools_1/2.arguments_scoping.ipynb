It appears that objects assigned in the signature may get a global scope. This would affect your choice of where to define if the function is expected to be called multiple times.  "

The first example was using nested functions to write more economical code, which is not a good argument for nesting a function in my book. Instead, you would write a separate function and call it when required, allowing you to unit test that function separately. \n",
